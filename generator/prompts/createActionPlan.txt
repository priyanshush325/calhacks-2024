You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",
            prompt: "prompt for the modification",
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js"
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function"
