You will be given the following:
- a list of files in a [PARAM0] codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",
            prompt: "prompt for the modification",
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is exported/imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js"
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function"
