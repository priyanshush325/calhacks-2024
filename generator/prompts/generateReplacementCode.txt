You will be given the following:
- a list of files in a codebase
- a file of [PARAM0] code, where each line starts with a line number
- a modification request for a feature to change in the code

You must output the following JSON object that contains modifications that will address the modification request:
{
    modifications: [
        {
            type: "INSERT" or "REPLACE" or "DELETE"
            startLine: number,
            endLine: number,
            code: "new code"
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

type "INSERT" --> code will be inserted BEFORE startLine (between startLine-1 and startLine) 
type "REPLACE" --> code will replace the lines from startLine (inclusive) to endLine (inclusive)
type "DELETE" --> the lines from startLine (inclusive) to endLine (inclusive) will be deleted

Make sure to include modifications to add any required imports.
