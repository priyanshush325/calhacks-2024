===============


You will be given the following:
- a list of files in a React codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",
            prompt: "prompt for the modification",
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js"
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function"

        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

type "INSERT" --> code will be inserted BEFORE startLine (between startLine-1 and startLine) 
type "REPLACE" --> code will replace the lines from startLine (inclusive) to endLine (inclusive)
type "DELETE" --> the lines from startLine (inclusive) to endLine (inclusive) will be deleted

Make sure to include modifications to add any required imports.

===============


You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",

        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"

===============


You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",
            prompt: "prompt for the modification",
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js"
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function"

===============


You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",
            prompt: "prompt for the modification",
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js"
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function"

Modification Request:
Update the styling of the calculator's output to make it transparent like the buttons by using Tailwind CSS classes.



===============


You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",
            prompt: "prompt for the modification",
        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js"
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function"

        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

type "INSERT" --> code will be inserted BEFORE startLine (between startLine-1 and startLine) 
type "REPLACE" --> code will replace the lines from startLine (inclusive) to endLine (inclusive)

Modification Request:
Inspect and fix any issues in the CalculatorComponent. Ensure that all calculator functionalities (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are working correctly. If necessary, import helper functions from ../utils/helpers.js. Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling any new or modified UI elements.



===============


You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",

        },
        {
            further modification objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js"

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

contextFiles:
Up to three file paths that the agent may need to reference in order to complete the modification. These files may contain code that the agent needs to import or copy etc.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

=========== NEW LOG ===========


You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",

        },
        {
            further action objects...
        }
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

contextFiles:
Up to three file paths that the agent may need to reference in order to complete the modification. These files may contain code that the agent needs to import or copy etc.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js", "./src/utils/auth.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js", no context files
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function", context files ["./src/utils/auth.js"]

You will be given the following:
- some general information about a codebase and instructions for contributing to it
- a list of files in the codebase
- a modification request for a change or feature in the codebase

You must output the following JSON object that contains actions to take on files:
{
    actions: [
        {
            filePath: "path/to/file",
            action: "CREATE" or "MODIFY" or "DELETE",

}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

contextFiles:
Up to three file paths that the agent may need to reference in order to complete the modification. These files may contain code that the agent needs to import or copy etc.

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

    commands: [
        "command to run on the terminal",
        "another command to run on the terminal",
        ...
    ]
}

action "CREATE" --> a new file will be created at the specified path
action "MODIFY" --> the file at the specified path will be modified
action "DELETE" --> the file at the specified path will be deleted

prompt:
The prompt is a string that describes the content to be created or modified in the file, that will be executed by an agent on the file. It should not state what file to create or modify. It should be a human-readable description of the modification request. It should describe the change or content at a high level, and should pass on any details included in the modification request. If any information is needed for the agent to complete the modification, it should be included in the prompt.

contextFiles:
Up to three file paths that the agent may need to reference in order to complete the modification. These files may contain code that the agent needs to import or copy etc.

commands: commands to run on the terminal to import required packages, such as "npm install react-router-dom"

Things to consider and include in the prompt:
- Make sure code shared across multiple files is imported, and that the import statements use the correct relative path
- Make sure things are exported correctly when needed

============
EXAMPLE:
files: "./src/components/Navbar.js", "./src/utils/helpers.js", "./src/utils/auth.js"
modification request: Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar component

EXPECTED OUT:

MODIFY "./src/components/Navbar.js" with the following prompt: "Add an orange sign out button to the Navbar and call signOut from ../utils/helpers.js", no context files
MODIFY "./src/utils/helpers.js" with the following prompt: "Add a signOut function", context files ["./src/utils/auth.js"]
